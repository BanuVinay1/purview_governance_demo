Purview + Fabric Governance Demo Suite
This repository showcases a hands-on, scenario-driven implementation of Microsoft Purview and Fabric governance capabilities. It includes lineage injection, EDM setup, SHIR scanning, and full lineage tracing across Fabric workloads â€” all backed by real-world troubleshooting and annotated screenshots.

ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Included
ðŸ”¹ PyApacheAtlas Lineage Injection
- Custom entity creation and lineage injection using PyApacheAtlas
- Sample scripts and JSON payloads for reproducible lineage graphs
- Covers SQL endpoints, Lakehouse, semantic models, and Power BI artifacts
ðŸ”¹ EDM Agent Setup & Troubleshooting
- Step-by-step notes for configuring the EDM Upload Agent
- Deep dive into schema extraction, encoding issues, and permission traps
- Annotated screenshots of agent errors and resolution paths
ðŸ”¹ SHIR Scan Behind Private Network
- Secure Hybrid Integration Runtime (SHIR) setup for scanning private resources
- Scan configuration, authentication flow, and resource discovery
- Real scan results and lineage propagation examples
ðŸ”¹ Fabric Lineage End-to-End
- Full lineage tracing from Power BI reports â†’ semantic model â†’ SQL endpoint â†’ Lakehouse
- Fabric workspace scan setup and lineage view walkthrough
- Screenshots of lineage graphs and metadata propagation

ðŸŽ¯ Why This Matters
This project demonstrates:
- Real-world governance implementation across hybrid and cloud-native systems
- Strategic troubleshooting and documentation for portfolio and onboarding use
- Modular demos that can be reused for client delivery, interviews, and community sharing

ðŸ“Œ Notes
- All screenshots are anonymized and annotated for clarity.
- Scripts are designed for demo use â€” adapt paths and credentials for production.
- Feedback and contributions welcome!
